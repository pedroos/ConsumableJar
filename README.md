# Consumable Jar
A repository of mathematical transcriptions and translations.

### Compiling

- Create and configure `gen2/conf.py` from `gen2/conf.py.sample`. Personalizing `gen_dir` with your repository's absolute path is enough.
- Run the following command on the repository root (Python 3 only supported):

```
python gen2/gen.py
```

- The output files are placed in the `out` directory.
